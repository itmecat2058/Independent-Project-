*Proposal*

You have enough skills now to define your own project. This can be independent or a collaborative effort (with limitations and expectations). Regardless of whether you'll be working alone or in groups, you need to start with a project proposal.

Think through something a website would be helpful for. This could be a site for a club or sport, an informative site on a topic you care about, a personal project (think the CSS grid project but much more in depth), or something you just want to try.

Submit your copy of the attached Google Doc detailing what you are going to do for this project. It needs to be detailed enough that you can follow it as a roadmap for development over the next several days, but loose enough that you can make adjustments as you come up on problems.

You are free to choose whatever technologies you'd like. If you want to focus on a static site (HTML, CSS) that's fine. If you want more interactive elements using Javascript, that's also fine - you decide what you want to really show off.

These projects will be published when they're finished.
